mean-stock-list-js
==================

An example of how to use AngularJS to create a very generic middleware for form validation with no page reloads. This particular codebase is a simple tool that enables the user to enter in a list of stocks they bought and the price + quantity. For a more detailed explanation, see http://thecodebarbarian.wordpress.com/2013/05/12/how-to-easily-validate-any-form-ever-using-angularjs/ . This code is an example only and is not meant to be used as is by anyone.
